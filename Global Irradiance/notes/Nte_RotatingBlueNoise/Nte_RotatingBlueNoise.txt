Rotating Blue Noise:
	Takes an input blue-noise texture/sprite and converts each pixel
	to radians by multiplying the noise pixel brightness by 2PI.
	
	Then adds a time offset converted to radians is seeded into the
	radial noise and finally converted back to normal space by diving
	by 2PI.
	
Why this method over Golden-Ratio Seeding?
	Using the Golden Ratio is proven to overall equalize and reduce
	noise throughout a scene, however this is not ideal for 2D application.
	
	When sampling frame-by-frame each lighting render leaves noise seeded
	throughout the scene due to using a low-ray count. Since we know this we
	can exploit the uniformity property of blue-noise by offseting the noise
	radially to fill in the noise gaps left by the previous light scene.
	
	This works because every pixel is offset by the same amount, perfectly
	preserving the blue-noise when converting to-and-from polar coordinate
	space (radians).
