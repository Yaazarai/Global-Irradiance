Global Irradiance:
	New method of 2D radiosity that vastly increases performance, visual
	fidelity and adds a new feature: refraction tracking.
	
	Refraction Tracking works by adding 2 grayscale versions of your light
	scene to the render pipeline. When the irradiance shader starts the
	raymarch it checks the current pixels interior refraction value--how
	much this pixel is willing to accumulate light data.
	
	Then as the raymarch is performed the refraction value across the
	raymarch is sampled and if that value differs from the current refraction
	value we take the minimum (lower) of the two refraction values. This way
	as a ray marches through the scene the refraction value will decrease as
	it passes through several surfaces.
	
	However in order for this to work, all occluders with non-zero refraction
	values--called visual occluders--must have their own SDF rendered and
	combined with the game scene's SDF. This is done by rendering all of the
	occluders to a separate surface, inverting the surface so that empty space
	becomes visible and occluder pixels become invisible. This allows us the
	SDF the interior surface of visible occluder objects making them visible
	in the final output light scene.
	
Methodologies Used:
	1. Rotating Blue Noise.
	2. Uniform Sparse Density Resampling.
	3. Per-Ray Surface Refraction Tracking.
	4. 2D Radiosity w/ Edge Sampling.
	5. Temporal Filtering.
