Temporal Filtering:
	You take the current frame light surface A and blend that with
	the previous frame light surface B to filter out noise over-time.
	
	PRO: Will significantly filter out noise (but not entirely) frame-by-frame.
	CON: Leaves a smearing/motion blur effect that could be hard on the eyes.
